As Mr. Smith walked towards the edge of the cliff, he recalled what his father had said to him. "Boy,", his father had started, "I must tell you this next thing before I go." But Mr. Smith had never gotten to hear what his father had to say, as at that moment his father had fallen over the side of the cliff. The very same cliff, Mr. Smith mused, that he himself was walking towards this very moment. "How Ms. Smith would laugh," he thought to himself, "if she were reading an account of his present actions."
